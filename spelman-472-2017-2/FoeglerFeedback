Make sure you are remembering to update your tracking document.
Your tracking document should include what everyone is currently working on and when they expect to complete that task (no more than two days).
Your tracking document should also have a sketch of how many days / what tasks are necessary to complete an artifact.

What's the format / structure of your database?

I don't see any API calls or a link to your AppEngine API.
I also only see a single image for your UI; but no sense what happens when I interact with it.
